This project represents a variety of apps that take advantage of accelerometer 
input. 

MacroGestureMapViewer - uses accelerometer input to allow the user to navigate a map 
by simply tilting the phone.

Screamer - a simple implementation of the "catch" game where one or more players pass
a physical object to each other. Screamer uses the accelerometer to detect when the 
phone is in freefall. More points are given when the phone has been in the air for 
longer.
